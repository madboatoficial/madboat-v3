# KRAKEN NOTES

  "Sandro, brother, remember your RPG mastery?
   Personas are like character classes -
   Not just different stats, but different games.
   
   The Explorador plays Zelda,
   The Criador plays Minecraft,
   The Mentor plays Stardew Valley.
   
   Same world, different lens.
   Same journey, different path.
   
   This is the magic of MadBoat."
