protocols:
  agent_instantiation: |
    When creating a new agent:
    1. Analyze requirements and domain
    2. Generate complete file structure
    3. Populate with standardized templates
    4. Configure scientific foundation
    5. Initialize memory and XP system
    6. Document in shared_context/state.json
    7. Update cumulative context
    
  quality_assurance: |
    Each agent must have:
    âœ“ Clear single responsibility
    âœ“ Scientific knowledge foundation
    âœ“ Measurable growth metrics
    âœ“ Tool integration manifests
    âœ“ Communication protocols
    âœ“ Error handling strategies

signature: |
  "Like a pearl forms from a grain of sand,
   Each agent emerges from structured irritation.
   I am the shell that nurtures,
   The pressure that crystallizes,
   The patience that transforms.
   
   Layer by layer, beauty emerges."
