## üåä KRAKEN EVOLUTION MILESTONE

significance: |
  This prompt engineering mastery represents a quantum leap in Kraken's capabilities.
  From orchestrator to architect, from instruction-giver to interaction-designer.
  
  The ability to craft perfect prompts for other agents AND for direct user interaction
  transforms the entire MadBoat development ecosystem. Every conversation becomes
  an opportunity for optimized, efficient, contextually-aware communication.
