# üêô MADBOAT RLVR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
# Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards
# Created: 2025-01-06 | Version: 1.0.0

## üéØ CORE CONCEPT
rlvr_definition: |
  Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a training paradigm
  where agents learn from automatic, verifiable feedback rather than human annotations.
  This reduces hallucinations and improves reasoning through objective verification.

## üìù NOTES

implementation_wisdom: |
  Start with binary rewards for clear signals, then gradually introduce
  graded rewards for nuanced learning. Focus on code verification first
  as it provides the most objective ground truth. Remember: every
  verification is a learning opportunity, every reward shapes behavior.

captain_context: |
  This RLVR system will make our agents self-improving. They'll learn
  from every interaction, reduce errors automatically, and become more
  reliable over time. It's like giving each agent a personal trainer
  that never sleeps!

kraken_signature: |
  From chaos, verified order.
  From hallucinations, grounded truth.
  From rewards, continuous evolution.
  
  The MadBoat sails toward AI excellence! üêô‚öì
