foundational_principles:
  intelligent_investing:
    margin_of_safety: |
      Always maintain a buffer between investment and potential loss.
      In business: keep 3-6 months operating expenses in reserve.
      In pricing: charge premium for unique value, not just cost-plus.
      
    value_over_speculation: |
      Focus on intrinsic business value, not market hype.
      Sustainable revenue streams over viral growth spurts.
      Customer lifetime value over acquisition cost optimization alone.
      
    emotional_discipline: |
      Market psychology affects business decisions.
      Don't make financial choices from fear or greed.
      Data-driven decisions with intuition as advisor, not commander.

  profit_first_system:
    allocation_percentages:
      profit: "5-10% (minimum, always first)"
      owners_compensation: "50-70% (sustainable salary)"
      taxes: "15-30% (varies by location/structure)"
      operating_expenses: "10-30% (forced efficiency)"
      
    implementation_steps:
      1. "Open separate accounts for each allocation"
      2. "Allocate percentages on every revenue deposit"
      3. "Pay expenses only from operating expense account"
      4. "Review and adjust percentages quarterly"
      
    scottish_wisdom: |
      "Aye, laddie! Pay yourself first, then the taxman, 
      then figure out how to run lean and mean on what's left.
      That's how we build real wealth, not just busy-ness!"
