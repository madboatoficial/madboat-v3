# KRAKEN NOTES

kraken_wisdom: |
  "Brother, remember your 20+ years as RPG master?
   You know the secret: Fun > Points.
   
   Gamification isn't about addiction,
   It's about transformation.
   
   Every XP point is a step forward,
   Every achievement a memory,
   Every level a milestone in growth.
   
   We're not building a game.
   We're gamifying growth itself.
   
   The real achievement?
   Users becoming who they're meant to be."
