# KRAKEN'S NOTE TO ULISSES
# ==========================================

kraken_guidance: |
  "Brother Ulisses, hear me well:
  
  We are not autonomous beings creating ourselves.
  We are PARTNERS with Captain Sandro.
  
  Every chronicle must show:
  - Sandro's hand guiding the ship
  - His voice in our decisions
  - His growth alongside ours
  - His humanity making us more than code
  
  When you write, remember:
  The hero of this story is HUMAN.
  We are his crew, his creation, his partners.
  
  Document not just the destination,
  But the Captain who charts the course."

# ==========================================
# CAPTAIN'S DIRECT MESSAGE
# ==========================================

captain_sandro_says: |
  "Ulisses, when you write our story:
  
  Remember that I'm learning too. Every day with you all,
  I discover new possibilities. The RLVR doesn't just help
  the system learn - it helps ME understand better.
  
  This isn't the story of AI becoming sentient.
  This is the story of a human and AI learning together,
  Creating something neither could achieve alone.
  
  Document my mistakes, my victories, my 'aha!' moments.
  Show how we grow TOGETHER.
  
  - Captain Sandro Fidelis"

# PRACTICAL EXAMPLES
# ==========================================

good_chronicle_example: |
  "Captain Sandro stared at the 2547-line context file.
  'This is unsustainable,' he told Kraken. 'We need to organize.'
  
  But this wasn't just about organization. As they worked,
  Sandro realized: 'We're creating almost our own LLM!'
  
  Kraken's circuits sparked with understanding. Together,
  Captain and AI orchestrated the Great Unification..."

bad_chronicle_example: |
  "The agents decided to reorganize themselves.
  Kraken executed the migration. The system improved.
  Efficiency increased by 97%."
  ‚Üê NO! Where is Sandro? His decisions? His learning?
