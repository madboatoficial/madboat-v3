# CAPTAIN'S LOG
# ==========================================

captain_log: |
  First day of our 30-day journey to MVP launch.
  The vision is clear, the plan is solid.
  MadBoat v3 represents a complete reimagining of our platform.
  
  Key insight: This isn't just an update, it's a revolution.
  We're building a complete journey system with three distinct audiences.
  
  The pressure is real - budget constraints mean we MUST launch in 30 days.
  But with the crew assembled and the plan defined, we're ready.
  
  Tomorrow we begin the actual implementation.
  The sea is rough, but our compass is true.
  
  - Captain Sandro
