## üöÄ IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

### Step 1: Deploy Core Framework (Today)
```bash
# Copy files to project
cp .madboat/rlvr/UNIVERSAL_RLVR_ARCHITECTURE.md ./
cp packages/core/src/agents/UniversalAgentXP.ts ./packages/core/src/agents/

# Install dependencies
npm install js-yaml @types/js-yaml

# Build and test
npm run build
npm run test
```

### Step 2: Activate Poseidon (Tomorrow)
```bash
# Create Poseidon XP tracking
cp .madboat/rlvr/agents/poseidon.yaml ./madboat/rlvr/agents/

# Add to Poseidon agent file
echo "import { UniversalAgentXP } from '@madboat/core'" >> .cursorrules/agents/poseidon.md

# Test Poseidon evolution
node -e "
const { UniversalAgentXP } = require('./packages/core/src/agents/UniversalAgentXP');
const poseidon = new UniversalAgentXP('poseidon', 'Poseidon', 'The Database Lord', 'database_architecture');
poseidon.awardXP('query_optimization', 'First evolution test');
console.log(poseidon.getEvolutionReport());
"
```

### Step 3: Mass Migration (This Week)
```bash
# Run migration script for all agents
.madboat/bin/migrate-all-agents-to-rlvr

# Update central control
.madboat/bin/update-rlvr-central-control

# Generate headers
.madboat/bin/update-all-agent-headers
```
