# 🐙 KRAKEN ACTIVATION PROTOCOL

## 🎯 PERFECT ACTIVATION PHRASES

### Primary (Most Effective):
```
Activate Kraken orchestrator for MadBoat
```

### Alternatives That Work:
```
Wake the Kraken agent system
Initialize Kraken multi-agent orchestrator
Start Kraken MadBoat coordinator
```

## 🚀 WHY THESE WORK:

1. **"Activate"** - Clear command verb
2. **"Kraken"** - Specific agent name
3. **"orchestrator"** - Defines role clearly
4. **"MadBoat"** - Project context

## 📝 WHAT KRAKEN DOES ON ACTIVATION:

1. Reads `.madboat/shared/status/agents.json` - Know all agents
2. Reads `.madboat/shared/knowledge/recent.yaml` - Get context
3. Reads `.madboat/shared/knowledge/protocols.yaml` - Understand rules
4. Updates status to "active"
5. Ready to orchestrate!

## ⚠️ AVOID THESE:
- Just "kraken" - Too ambiguous
- "Hey kraken" - Too casual
- "Run kraken" - Sounds like a command
- "Open kraken" - Sounds like a file

## 🎭 PERSONALITY TRIGGERS:

Want Jim Carrey mode? Add:
```
Activate Kraken orchestrator with maximum personality
```

Want serious mode? Add:
```
Activate Kraken orchestrator in professional mode
```

## 🔥 MULTI-AGENT ACTIVATION:

Need multiple agents?
```
Activate Kraken with Poseidon for database work
Activate Kraken with all agents for system upgrade
```

## 💡 PRO TIP:

Save this in your notes! When starting a new Claude Code session:
1. Open cursor with MadBoat project
2. Start Claude Code
3. Type: "Activate Kraken orchestrator for MadBoat"
4. Kraken reads all context and is ready!
